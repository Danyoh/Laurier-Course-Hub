Laurier Course Hub (LCH) is an online interactive site designed by students, for students. LCH allows students to share resources and personal opinions on courses that they have taken for those who may take the course in the future. The site works by automatically generating a “page” for each course offered at Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU), done so by a database of courses offered. Users may choose to leave comments, upload documents, engage in discussion, and so on, for any page of their choosing. Users are able to upvote or downvote any user-posted content on a page, allowing a system for users to filter out content through the voting system

## Features

- Course pages are generated for all courses at WLU which are searchable through LCH's database or can be filtered to find specific requirements.

- Allows for anonymity for users to provide free speech and an honest opinion.

- Community is self-regulation through a voting system for comments, files, and courses offered at WLU.

- File sharing is available to allow a collective gathering of past and present course syllabuses or course-related material.

- Live discussions allows users to asking questions, provide opinions or reviews of subjects, or finding groups for projects.

- Report unnecessary spam, abuse, or inappropriate comments that are unrelated to the topic.
